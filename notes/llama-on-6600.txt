Running `llama.cpp` on an AMD 6600 GPU locally **is possible**, but it's not as straightforward as using an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA. Since `llama.cpp` primarily supports CPU execution, and optionally GPU via **OpenCL**, **Metal**, or **Vulkan**, your AMD 6600 GPU (which is RDNA2) can be used via **OpenCL** or **Vulkan**. Vulkan is usually more stable for AMD.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Running `llama.cpp` on AMD 6600 GPU

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

1. **AMD GPU Drivers**:

   * Install the latest **AMD GPU drivers** that include support for **OpenCL** and **Vulkan**.
   * On Linux: Use `amdgpu-install` or install via your package manager.
   * On Windows: Use the **Adrenalin** software from AMD.

2. **System Requirements**:

   * 8GB+ RAM recommended.
   * Enough VRAM (6600 has 8GB, which is good for \~7B models).

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   * **CMake**
   * **Make**
   * **Python 3.8+** (optional, for model conversion)

### 🧰 Clone and Build `llama.cpp` with Vulkan or OpenCL

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

#### 2. Build with OpenCL (or Vulkan)

You have two options here:

---

### Option 1: OpenCL (more common, but slower and less stable than Vulkan)

```bash
cmake -B build -DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Then use the OpenCL backend by running:

```bash
./build/bin/main -m models/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 50
```

> `-ngl 50` means 50 layers offloaded to GPU. Adjust based on your GPU VRAM.

---

### Option 2: Vulkan (faster & better for AMD GPUs)

#### a. Build with Vulkan support

```bash
cmake -B build -DLLAMA_VULKAN=on
cmake --build build --config Release
```

#### b. Run with Vulkan backend

```bash
./build/bin/main -m models/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 50 --vulkan
```

> Use `--vulkan` to enable Vulkan. You might also need to specify Vulkan device if multiple GPUs are present.

## 📦 Download a GGUF Model

You need to use models in the **`.gguf` format**. You can get them from:

* [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke)
* Example for 7B model:

  ```bash
  wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf
  ```

Place it in the `models/` directory.

---

## ✅ Run Example Command

```bash
./build/bin/main -m models/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 50 --vulkan
```

This command will:

* Load the LLaMA 2 7B model
* Use Vulkan GPU acceleration
* Offload 50 layers to the GPU (adjust as needed)

---

## 🧪 Check Vulkan / OpenCL Devices (optional)

You can use tools to check if your GPU is recognized:

* `vulkaninfo` (Linux)
* `clinfo` (for OpenCL)

---

## 🧠 Tips

* Keep model quantized (Q4 or Q5) to save VRAM.
* Start with a small number of layers offloaded (`-ngl 20`) and increase if stable.
* Use `--prompt` or interactive mode for testing.

If you're on **Linux or Windows**, or using **WSL**, the steps vary slightly—let me know and I can tailor the instructions.
