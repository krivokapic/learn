Create a script, e.g., ~/scripts/chat_popup.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Launch Firefox with a unique window title/class
firefox --new-window https://www.chat.com --class chatpopup &

Make it executable:
chmod +x ~/scripts/chat_popup.sh

Edit your i3 config (~/.config/i3/config) and add this rule:
for_window [class="chatpopup"] floating enable, move position center
    This makes any window with the class "chatpopup" floating and centered.

You can also add this optional line to give it a size:
for_window [class="chatpopup"] resize set 800 600

Optional: Bind a key to launch it

Add this line to your i3 config to bind it to, for example, $mod+c:
bindsym $mod+c exec ~/scripts/chat_popup.sh

Reload i3:

$mod+Shift+r

Now when you press $mod+c, it will:

    Open https://www.chat.com in Firefox,

    The window will be floating and centered.
