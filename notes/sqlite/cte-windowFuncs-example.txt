Nice—let’s make these feel simple and useful, not just abstract toys. I’ll give you the intuition, plain-language analogies, short examples, and a couple of small exercises you can try.

# What a CTE (Common Table Expression) *really* is

Think of a CTE as a **named, temporary sub-query** — like writing a mini spreadsheet tab with a name that you can reference in the rest of your query. It makes complex SQL readable by breaking it into steps.

Analogy: if a query is a recipe, a CTE is “preparing an ingredient” (chop onions, simmer sauce) and giving it a name so the rest of the recipe reads clearly.

Basic form:

```sql
WITH step1 AS (
  -- a query that returns rows
  SELECT ...
),
step2 AS (
  -- another query that can use step1
  SELECT ... FROM step1 ...
)
SELECT * FROM step2;
```

Why use CTEs?

* readability: name intermediate results
* reuse: reference the same result multiple times
* composition: break problem into steps
* recursive logic: express hierarchical or iterative queries (more on that below)

# Short CTE example — clarity over cleverness

Sample data (conceptual): `sales(id, salesperson, region, sale_date, amount)`

We want region totals and then the top 2 sales rows in each region by amount.

```sql
WITH region_totals AS (
  SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS region_total
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY region
),
ranked_sales AS (
  SELECT
    s.*,
    rt.region_total,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.region ORDER BY s.amount DESC) AS rn
  FROM sales s
  JOIN region_totals rt USING (region)
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_sales WHERE rn <= 2;
```

What happened:

1. `region_totals` computes totals — like making a small table.
2. `ranked_sales` combines per-row data with the totals and ranks rows per region.
3. Final `SELECT` picks the top 2 per region.

# Window functions — the core idea

Window functions compute aggregates **without collapsing rows**. You get an aggregate *value* for each row based on a “window” of rows related to that row.

Analogy: suppose you have a ledger and for each line item you want to write the running balance on that same line — window functions let you write that extra column without folding rows together.

Key parts:

* `OVER(...)` is mandatory and defines the window.
* `PARTITION BY` splits rows into groups (like GROUP BY boundaries), but does **not** collapse rows.
* `ORDER BY` inside `OVER()` defines ordering for running aggregates, ranks, and frames.
* Frame clause (`ROWS BETWEEN ...`) controls exactly which rows in the partition the function sees (useful for moving averages, running totals).

Common examples:

* ranking: `ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()`
* offsets: `LAG(), LEAD()`
* aggregates per row: `SUM() OVER(...)`, `AVG() OVER(...)`, `COUNT() OVER(...)`
* statistical: `PERCENT_RANK(), CUME_DIST()`

# Concrete window examples (step-by-step)

Assume simplified `sales` table rows:

| id | salesperson | region | sale\_date | amount |
| -- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 1  | Ana         | East   | 2025-01-01 | 100    |
| 2  | Bob         | East   | 2025-01-05 | 200    |
| 3  | Ana         | East   | 2025-01-07 | 150    |
| 4  | Cam         | West   | 2025-01-02 | 300    |

1. **Region total on each row**

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region) AS region_total
FROM sales;
```

Result: each sale row gets a `region_total`. Rows remain; no aggregation collapse.

2. **Running total over time (global)**

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date
                    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
    AS running_total
FROM sales;
```

Each row’s `running_total` is the cumulative sum up to that date.

3. **Rank sales within each region**

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rn
FROM sales;
```

`rn = 1` is the largest sale in that region. Unlike GROUP BY, every sale row is preserved with its rank.

4. **Compare this month’s amount to previous sale for same salesperson**

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  LAG(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY sale_date) AS prev_amount
FROM sales;
```

`LAG` gives the previous row’s value in the salesperson partition.

# GROUP BY vs Window functions — pick the right tool

* `GROUP BY` aggregates and **reduces** rows (one row per group).
* Window functions keep **all rows**, adding columns computed over a window.

Use GROUP BY when you only need aggregated rows (totals per group). Use window functions when you need per-row detail *plus* aggregate context (percent of total, running sum, rank, comparison to neighbor rows).

# Recursive CTEs — the intuition

A recursive CTE is a way to **repeat a step until a condition** — like a loop in SQL. Great for:

* hierarchical data (org chart, folder tree)
* generating series (dates)
* iterative calculations

Structure:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE t AS (
  -- anchor member
  SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
  UNION ALL
  -- recursive member: references t
  SELECT ... FROM t JOIN ... WHERE ...
)
SELECT * FROM t;
```

Example: walk an `employees(id, name, manager_id)` tree from CEO downward:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE team AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS depth
  FROM employees
  WHERE id = 1   -- CEO start

  UNION ALL

  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, t.depth + 1
  FROM employees e
  JOIN team t ON e.manager_id = t.id
)
SELECT * FROM team;
```

This returns the CEO, then all direct reports, then their reports, etc., with `depth`.

# Practical tips and pitfalls

* CTEs are primarily for readability; the optimizer may inline them in many DBs (not always materialized).
* Use window functions to avoid expensive self-joins for running sums or ranks.
* Ordering matters: `ORDER BY` inside `OVER()` affects running aggregates and ranks.
* Be careful with frames: default for `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` can differ by DB — explicit `ROWS BETWEEN` is safer for precise control.
* Large partitions or wide frames can be costly — watch performance and indexes.
* Some DBs (older MySQL) had limited window function support — check your engine/version.

# Short exercises (try these)

1. For each salesperson, list their total sales and each sale row showing “percent of their total” (answer hint: window `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson)`).
2. Show the top 3 sales per region (hint: use `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC)` inside a CTE or subquery).
3. Given an `orders(order_date, amount)`, compute a 7-day moving average (hint: `AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`).

If you want, I can write answers for those and run through the exact output rows for a small data sample.

Want me to: (A) show the full SQL for the exercises with example data and result tables, (B) show a recursive CTE example with a tree and visualized output, or (C) give performance & explainers specific to Postgres / MySQL / SQL Server?
